I'll create a comprehensive set of bash scripts to manage a GitHub project board based on your implementation plan structure. This will include parsing the markdown file, creating milestones/issues, and updating progress.

Now let me create additional helper scripts for specific workflows:

Now let me create a comprehensive README and example files:

I've created a comprehensive set of bash scripts for managing GitHub projects based on your implementation plan structure. Here's what I've provided:

## Main Scripts:

1. **`gh-project-manager.sh`** - The core script that:
   - Parses markdown implementation plans
   - Creates GitHub milestones from phases
   - Creates GitHub issues from sections
   - Adds tasks as checkboxes in issue bodies
   - Updates task completion status
   - Manages caching to avoid duplicates

2. **`gh-project-sync.sh`** - Synchronizes plan changes:
   - Detects changes in the implementation plan
   - Updates GitHub to match the plan
   - Maintains sync state

3. **`gh-project-progress.sh`** - Shows detailed progress:
   - Visual progress bars for milestones and issues
   - Task completion percentages
   - Overall project statistics
   - Color-coded status indicators

4. **`gh-project-bulk-update.sh`** - Bulk task updates:
   - Update multiple tasks from a checklist file
   - Useful for marking many tasks complete at once

5. **`gh-project-export.sh`** - Export project state:
   - Exports milestones and issues to JSON
   - Generates markdown reports
   - Creates checklist files for bulk updates

6. **`gh-project-watch.sh`** - Auto-sync on changes:
   - Watches the plan file for modifications
   - Automatically syncs when changes are detected
   - Configurable check interval

## Key Features:

- **Intelligent Parsing**: Uses AWK to parse the markdown structure and extract phases, sections, and tasks
- **Caching**: Prevents duplicate creation of milestones and issues
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and helpful error messages
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded output and progress bars
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment variables for customization
- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Leverages the official `gh` tool for API access

## Usage Example:

```bash
# Initial setup - create all milestones and issues
./gh-project-manager.sh create

# Update a specific task as completed
./gh-project-manager.sh update-task 42 "Create Element entity types" true

# Check progress
./gh-project-progress.sh

# Bulk update from a checklist
./gh-project-bulk-update.sh completed-tasks.txt

# Watch for changes and auto-sync
./gh-project-watch.sh
```

The scripts handle the hierarchical structure of your implementation plan:
- **Phases** → GitHub Milestones
- **Sections** → GitHub Issues (linked to appropriate milestone)
- **Tasks** → Checkboxes within issue bodies


The system maintains state through a local cache, supports incremental updates, and provides comprehensive progress tracking. All scripts include proper error handling, help documentation, and work together as a cohesive project management system.
